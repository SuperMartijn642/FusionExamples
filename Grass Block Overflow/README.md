This example resource pack makes grass from grass blocks overflow onto other blocks for a smoother transition.

There are three parts to accomplishing this:
1. Create a connecting grass texture with the `overlay` layout and grass tinting.
2. Create a model consisting of just a top face with the grass overflow texture.
3. Create a block model modifier which adds the model to the blocks we want grass to overflow onto.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
