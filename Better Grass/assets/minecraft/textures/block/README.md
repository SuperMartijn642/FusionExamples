Here we replace the grass block side overlay texture with specifically crafted connecting texture.
As mentioned for the model, we will use a `full` layout connecting texture with only the following cases:
- It connects to every direction, but the bottom
- It connects to every direction, but not bottom left or not bottom right
- It connects to all directions
