This example resource pack makes it so the diamond sword uses a special texture when it is enchanted with fire aspect.
This is accomplished using an item model modifier which checks for the fire aspect enchantment.

There are three parts to this example:
1. Create a texture for the enchanted diamond sword.
2. Create an item model which uses the enchanted texture.
3. Use an item model modifier to overwrite the diamond sword model when it is enchanted with fire aspect.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
