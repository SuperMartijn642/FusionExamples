This example resource pack makes the tuff bricks texture randomly pick from a number of variations.

There are two parts to accomplishing this:
1. Overwrite the tuff bricks texture with a `random` texture.
2. Overwrite the model for the tuff bricks block with a `base` model.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
