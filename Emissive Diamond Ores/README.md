This example resource pack makes the diamond bits of diamond ore look emissive.
This is accomplished by overlaying a second emissive texture of just the diamond parts of the texture over the regular model.

There are three parts to accomplishing this:
1. Create an emissive texture of just the diamond parts of the diamond ore texture.
2. Create a cube model of the emissive texture.
3. Overlay the emissive model over the diamond ore using a block model modifier.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
