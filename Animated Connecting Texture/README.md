This example resource pack shows an animated connecting texture. The diorite block is used as an example to show the texture.

There are two parts to this example:
1. Replace the diorite texture with an animated connecting texture.
2. Overwrite the model for diorite, `assets/minecraft/block/diorite.json`, with a connecting model.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
