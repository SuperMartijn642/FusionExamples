This example resource pack makes it so the stick texture changes when the stack size increases.

There are three parts to this example:
1. Create stick textures for different stack sizes.
2. Create a model for each of the stick textures.
3. Use an item model modifier to use new models depending on the stack size.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
