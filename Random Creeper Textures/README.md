This example resource pack makes it so the stick texture changes when the stack size increases.

There are two parts to this example:
1. Create some alternative creeper textures in `textures/entity/`.
2. Create a model modifier to change the textures for the creeper.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
