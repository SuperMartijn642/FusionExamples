This example resource pack adds an animated conveyor belt texture using the `scrolling` texture type.
To demonstrate the texture, the texture is applied to the andesite block.

There are two parts to this example:
1. Create the conveyor belt texture with appropriate metadata.
2. Overwrite the model for andesite to use the conveyor belt texture.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
