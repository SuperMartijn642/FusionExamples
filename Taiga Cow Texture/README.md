This example resource pack changes the cow texture for cows spawned in a taiga biome.

There are two parts to this example:
1. Create a new cow texture in `textures/entity/`.
2. Create a model modifier to change the texture for cows in a taiga biome.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
