Here the diorite texture is replaced with an animated connecting texture.
The texture uses the `horizontal` connecting texture layout. Similar to a regular animated texture, the image can then simply be repeated vertically for each frame.  
The metadata file contains both, the fusion metadata for the connecting texture, and the vanilla animation metadata.
