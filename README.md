# Fusion Examples
This repository hosts a number of examples which use the various resource pack features available in Fusion.
Each folder contains a different example and each folder is a valid resource pack and can be loaded in the game.

> [!TIP]  
> If you are making a resource pack you will likely need a copy of vanilla's resources as a reference.
> To get a copy of the vanilla resources you can follow the steps [on the Vanilla Resources page on the Fusion wiki](https://github.com/SuperMartijn642/Fusion/wiki/Vanilla-Resources).
