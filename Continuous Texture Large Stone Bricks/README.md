This example resource pack uses a texture spanning multiple blocks to make large stone bricks. 

There are two parts to accomplishing this:
1. Overwrite the stone bricks texture with a `continuous` texture.
2. Overwrite the model for the stone bricks block with a `base` model.

More information is available in the directories of the respective files.

The result will look like this:
