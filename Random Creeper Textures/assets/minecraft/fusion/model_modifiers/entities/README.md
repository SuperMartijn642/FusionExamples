The example uses an entity model modifier which targets the creeper entity.
The creeper has 2 layers: `creeper/main` and `creeper/armor`. The latter is used for the charged creeper overlay.
The entity model modifier overwrites the textures for the `creeper/main` layer to use the 3 textures added as well as the regular creeper texture.
